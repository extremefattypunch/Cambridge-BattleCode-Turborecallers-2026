# CAMBC Bot API — OCaml

Event: cambc2026a. Read alongside GameRules.md. Signatures and descriptions come from the same SDK documentation shown on the Bot API page.

Examples are fragments for an initialised bot. Check visibility and action preconditions. 

```ocaml
open Cambc
```

## Cambc

### Cambc_error

```ocaml
exception Cambc_error of Error_code.t * string
```

Raised by every failing call.

Public SDK type declaration.

```ocaml
exception Cambc_error of Error_code.t * string
```

### camp

```ocaml
type camp
```



Public SDK type declaration.

```ocaml
type camp
```

### champion

```ocaml
type champion
```



Public SDK type declaration.

```ocaml
type champion
```

### champions

```ocaml
val champions : ?team:Team.t -> unit -> Champion.t list
```

`champions ?team ()` is every roster champion, including hidden ones. @param team Team to include; both teams when omitted.

**gameplay**: This function can only be used by champion bots and is not usable during draft phase.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

```ocaml
let result = champions ()
```

### constants

```ocaml
val constants : unit -> Constants.t
```

Game constants loaded at startup.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

```ocaml
let result = constants ()
```

### debug_block

```ocaml
val debug_block : (unit -> unit) -> unit
```

`debug_block f` runs `f` without spending fuel when the bot is built in debug mode (`cambc run`, the default); skipped entirely in release mode (`--release`, and always on the platform). The free budget per block is 1000 turns, beyond which the rest is charged; ending the turn inside closes the free window. Usage: `debug_block (fun () -> expensive_debug_operation ())`. @param f Runs in debug mode only; never called in release mode.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

Inputs:
- value1: (unit -> unit) (types from Cambc)

```ocaml
let result = debug_block value1
```

### end_turn

```ocaml
val end_turn : unit -> unit
```

End the current turn.

Stop optional planning when little fuel remains and yield the current turn.

```ocaml
let yield_if_low_on_fuel () =
  if fuel_remaining () < 1000 then end_turn ()
```

### fuel_remaining

```ocaml
val fuel_remaining : unit -> int
```

Fuel left in the current turn.

Stop optional planning when little fuel remains and yield the current turn.

```ocaml
let yield_if_low_on_fuel () =
  if fuel_remaining () < 1000 then end_turn ()
```

### get_item_enum

```ocaml
val get_item_enum : ?shard:bool -> Item_family.t -> Item_stat.t -> Item.t
```

Select an item by family and stat. `shard` defaults to `true`; `false` selects an emblem.

Select a completed Greed strength emblem by family and stat. Shards are the default in C++, Python and OCaml; Rust takes an explicit boolean.

```ocaml
let item = get_item_enum ~shard:false Item_family.Greed Item_stat.Strength
```

### global_submitted_gems

```ocaml

```

### init

```ocaml
val init : unit -> unit
```

Load the SDK caches. This already runs at startup, before the bot's modules; calling it again does nothing.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

```ocaml
let result = init ()
```

### is_draft

```ocaml
val is_draft : unit -> bool
```

True when this instance runs the draft rather than controlling a champion.

exception No_range
```

### resign

```ocaml
val resign : unit -> unit
```

Resign the game for the bot's team.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

```ocaml
let result = resign ()
```

### round_number

```ocaml
val round_number : unit -> int
```

The current round number.

Use this value in your bot's draft or turn logic.

```

Ability metadata. For the `Dash` variant: Landing effects apply to enemies and camps only after a successful dash. `range`: Maximum dash travel distance in tiles. Diagonal steps count as one; the destination must be a different tile reachable by a legal dash path. `radius`: Chebyshev radius in tiles around the landing tile for damage and stun; 1 includes all eight neighbouring tiles. `modifier`: Landing damage multiplier: base damage = caster Focus * modifier, before damage bonuses and mitigation. 0 disables landing damage. `duration`: Stun duration applied on landing, in turns; 0 disables stun. This is not the dash travel time.
